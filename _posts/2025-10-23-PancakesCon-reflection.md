title: "Thoughts After PancakesCon 6"

It's been a few weeks since PancakesCon 6 happened. I gave a presentation called "SOC-in-the-VBox and How Brush Lettering Taught Me to Sit." The technical part aimed to provide steps on how to run Eric Capuano's "So You Want to Be a SOC Analyst" series in VirtualBox, since the series used VMWare as the hypervisor instead. There were other great talks and a lot of cool people in the chats with all kinds of questions being asked. As a first-time presenter, this was a great event to participate in.

I wrote this post for those folks who were thinking about giving a talk. I hope my experience and thoughts add to the information out there that will help motivate folks to take risks on behalf of  themselves.

When I came across PancakesCon it was just in time for them to announce their CFP (Call for Papers). My immediate concern was that I didn't have a topic to talk about and didn't have any real idea of what a talk could be. Thankfully PancakesCon opened up a CFP Mentorship chat and so I put out the question: For someone who is transitioning into IT and cybersecurity and without much technical experience overall, what advice would you give on topic selection?

The answers that folks gave were great. The key recommendation that got me moving forward was: do not say no on behalf of the reviewer. Do your best, get help in order to do your best, and put your best out there.

I appreciated the comments about opening up to topics beyond the technical. The variety of work within IT and cybersecurity meant that a talk didn't have to be a hands-on-keyboard or hardware hacking experience. Parallel experiences for career changers, how audits work, or how you learned something were all valid topics. Reading this advice helped relieve some pressure I felt that my talk had to be technical to be valid.

The last piece advice was to commit to the topic. There was a comment about how writers are only vaguely prepared to write about a proposed topic. Committing to the topic makes them prepare well and the project usually works out.

To these recommendations I'd like to add 2 ideas.
    - the appeal of a topic will come out because of your genuine curiosity about the topic
    - your genuine curiosity will be sparked only if you choose a(ny) direction to move towards

Spinning your wheels on what topic to research won't move you forward in any direction. If you chose at least 2 topics so you could compare and contrast how appealing they are to you first, you'd start translating that spin into motion. Whatever catches your attention in your initial research will be those first bits of information to spark possible topics. Or at least lead you down interesting rabbit holes.

One of the podcasts I love listening to is [Ologies](https://www.alieward.com/ologies) with Alie Ward where she interviews some of the best experts in the many -ologies out there. An experience that often pops up in the interviews is that they became an expert in their field not by choice but because that was the field that unfolded for them through an open lab position or a senior researcher needing help with a topic. Of the many possible paths of study in their fields, they moved into the avenue most accessible to them, not one they thought they *should* move into. And as they progressed down that path and understood more, they were able to find those pieces of information that were really interesting to them that they wanted to share with others.

All of this is to say that as you think about what interests you, find what sparks questions for you. Trust that as you answer those questions for yourself and walk that path of becoming an expert, you'll start feeling that rush that comes from mastery that you'll want others to feel. At this level of experience, wanting to share what I had learned motivated me much more than figuring out a topic that would get my proposal accepted. While some topics are more appealing than others this does not diminish the value of you learning something that you want to share with others. If my proposal had not been accepted, I had fully planned to release a blog series detailing what I would have talked about. So be curious, ask questions, and choose a(ny) path to travel down even if it's abandoned later. In all cases you will have learned something you can later teach.
