Attending Cyber Days 2025 was drinking information from a fire hose. Listening to so many perspectives felt like my days studying anatomy and physiology: just trying to absorb as much as I could as quickly as I could. The faster I could set up my internal framework the more I could retain from their ideas.

With so many useful presentations, the one I connected with the most was a panel with Richard Springer, Jacob George, Stuart Yearout, and Mike Holcomb. It stood out because of how familiar so many of the topics were both as a business owner and a healthcare provider. Proactive and reactive risk management, prioritization of risk based on financial impact, supply chain concerns- both in my suppliers and in me as a supplier, what makes the money and what supports the money-making.  I never put these labels to the activities but I recognize them now for what they were.

As a solo practitioner with 1 employee, hearing Stuart Yearout talk about BRED- Be Really Excited about Discipline- resonated in a double-edged way. I enjoyed great discipline with the money-making activity of providing treatments. I only half-heartedly provided similar discipline to the money-making support activities.

However I quickly came to the realization that those support activities could be supplemented by the community I served. My community handled marketing, following up on leads, providing me "intel" on what was happening in their community, and occasionally checking me on activities that were not supportive of my mission. I see the parallel in what Dragos' OT-CERT program and voluntary, anonymous reporting of incidents could be. I only caught part of Dawn Capelli's presentation but that kind of community support is very familiar.

These are initial thoughts and there is still a lot to process. But I am happy to have participated in the event and if I had been able to stay up later I would have loved to listen in on the APAC presentations. I was looking forward to Kristin Demoranville's and hope I'll be able to access a recording somewhere.
