My name is Michael Gonzalez and I have practiced acupuncture for 19 years. For 16 of those years I ran my own community acupuncture office, creating 2 jobs (including my own), losing 1 (not mine obviously), but surviving long enough to be stable through the cyclic highs and lows of the economy...oh and a pandemic.


I operated with harm reduction as one of my core ideas: meeting people where they were, on their own terms, with no expectation or pressure that any interaction would lead beyond meeting their current needs. I basically asked the question: how can I help you *now*? 


What does harm reduction in acupuncture have to do with IT and cybersecurity? Nothing. But the principles of harm reduction have their parallels in no-pressure collaboration with organizations. 


A recurring theme that presents itself is that the decision makers have no will to implement technical solutions unless they see *relatable evidence* of both the need and availability of resources to complete the project. Without this type of evidence, talking tech specs amounted to all intention but no will.


So here we have a situation where a technical practitioner needs to meet the organization where it's at. Can't afford that tier of service? OK, can we make progress in the right direction with a lower tier plus some janky but functional solution? Don't have the worker-power to implement janky but functional? OK, can we make progress in the right direction with gap measures and monitoring/logging? Just don't want to do anything to address its current state? OK, here's the plan for future reference with plain talk about the results of doing nothing, but also with any other possible avenues that could be useful to the organization.


Coming into cybersecurity with the experiences I've had implementing trauma-informed, harm-reducing practices in alternative medicine, this sounds incredibly familiar to me. I could have the perfect treatment plan but if the patient does not have the energy/will to follow through or simply wants to establish boundaries *as part of their healing* then I have to adjust those plans so we can make progress in the right direction. 


And the part about establishing boundaries includes a subtlety it took me some time to make part of myself: I have no idea what that patient's situation looks like outside of our time together. Just like the way I don't have the complete picture of what the organization's situation looks like as we work together as employer/employee or contractor.


So when I ask the question "how can I help you *now*", it's with the understanding that there will be a natural push and pull as we negotiate what each side needs in our collaboration.
