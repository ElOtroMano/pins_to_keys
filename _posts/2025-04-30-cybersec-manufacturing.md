One of the great things about cybersec is how open folks are with information. One of the sources I want to talk about today is (CS)2AI's symposium on Cyber Security for Critical Manufacturing that happened on 2025-4-23. I just recently began thinking more about what it takes to protect infrastructure and it just so happened that this symposium happened as I made final preparations for my GCIH exam; this just meant that I had energy and time to look away from my books and screens. And it was REALLY interesting to hear about the digital + physical processes that must play nice together in order to maintain and protect the uptime of the production line.


None of the presentations was especially technical (even though the follow up questions were) except for the one by Dr. Matthias Neidermaier. And this one stood out to me because it was about creating a low-cost, open source industrial security testbed. He spoke about creating a physical ICS board using a Raspberry Pi 2 Zero, a PCB and other small components that totaled about $75. My understanding is that a chunk of that $75 is simply that he couldn't get a single PCB so had to order a bundle. 


The part that made this uniquely appealing to me was that he created virtualized hardware for a virtual testbed. I haven't jumped in to play with this yet but trust that it's on the to-do list. This may even become a project for my dad and me since he has experience that I don't have with electronic components. You can check out Dr. Neidermaier's CybICS repository here: https://github.com/mniedermaier/CybICS.


There were other great talks including a panel with Reynaldo Gonzalez, Adnan Ahmed, and Erik Knapp. The presentations offered a lot of great info as a newbie to almost everything. And maybe because I'm listening with new ears this is the overarching theme that I caught from nearly all the presenters and especially the panel: the communication between humans is both the key and obstacle to progress. Almost all presenters addressed the human factor in some way. Adnan spoke about the need for IT and OT to in essence "walk a mile in each other's shoes." Reynaldo spoke specifically about the need for someone in IT or OT to be proactive in wanting help, that someone needed to make the move to build bridges. Eric told a story about someone in IT shadowing the OT team for a month in order to create a plan for proper communications. 


The way each presenter spoke about the difficulty in communication makes me think this is a perennial issue. I wonder if it's more like the difference between Spanish and Italian than between international Spanish speakers. My understanding drops in and out when I hear Italian; there are big gaps in the flow of information that I have to make assumptions about. Whereas with international Spanish speakers it's mainly idioms I miss, but those are easily explained and we can keep a good exchange going. How big is this difficulty?


This was a great intro to a lot of new ideas for me. I'm looking forward to following the series of [symposiums](https://www.cs2ai.org/cs2aionline) (CS)2AI has set up for the year. I'm really excited to attend the next one on cyber security for the healthcare sector happening 2025-05-14.
